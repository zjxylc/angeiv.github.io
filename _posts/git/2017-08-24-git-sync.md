Git fork 后同步upstream

## 查看当前配置的远端仓库

```
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (push)
```

## 配置远端仓库

1. Open Terminal

2. List the current configured remote repository for your fork

```
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (push)
```

3. Specify a new remote upstream repository that will be synced with the fork

```
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git
```

4. Verify the new upstream repository you've specified for your fork.

```
$ git remote -v
origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (push)
upstream  https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git (push)
```

## 同步fork

1. Open Terminal

2. Change the current working directory to your local project

3. Fetch the branches and their respective commits from the upstream repository. Commits to `master` will be stored in a local branch, `upstream/master`

    ```
    $ git fetch upstream
    remote: Counting objects: 75, done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (53/53), done.
    remote: Total 62 (delta 27), reused 44 (delta 9)
    Unpacking objects: 100% (62/62), done.
    From https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY
    * [new branch]      master     -> upstream/master
    ```

4. Check out your fork's local `master` branch

    ```
    $ git checkout master
    Switched to branch 'master'
    ```

5. Merge the changes from `upstream/master` into your local `master` branch. This brings your fork's `master `branch into sync with the upstream repository, without losing your local changes

    ```
    $ git merge upstream/master
    Updating a422352..5fdff0f
    Fast-forward
    README                    |    9 -------
    README.md                 |    7 ++++++
    2 files changed, 7 insertions(+), 9 deletions(-)
    delete mode 100644 README
    create mode 100644 README.md
    ```

    If your local branch didn't have any unique commits, Git will instead perform a "fast-forward":

    ```
    $ git merge upstream/master
    Updating 34e91da..16c56ad
    Fast-forward
    README.md                 |    5 +++--
    1 file changed, 3 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
    ```

   > Tip: Syncing your fork only updates your local copy of the repository. To update your fork on GitHub, you must [push your changes](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote).
